description: Originally published in 1871, Ralph the Heir revolves around two men
  named Ralph. One is the nephew and legal heir of Squire Gregory Newton. The other
  is the squire's beloved illegitimate son and preferred heir. The fortunes and misfortunes
  of the actual heir, as he desperately seeks to pay off his debts and marry a woman
  of good social standing, form the core of the novel. Particularly noteworthy is
  the book's description of a corrupt Parliamentary electionprobably based on Trollope's
  own experience as a candidate.
